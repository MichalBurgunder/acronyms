# Dread it, Run from it: Acronyms still Arrive

Instead of wasting time looking at memes, and TikToks, a better use of one's time would be to try and answer a simple question: How many three letter acronyms (TLA) can a person recognize?

Given the complete lack of prior research on this most direly understudied field, I set out to find out, by looking at every single TLA, and seeing if I recognize it. You too, can do the same. 

## Getting Started

Download this repo, and delete the acronyms.csv file. On the bottom of the acronyms.py file, you will find two functions:

```
create_acronyms()
check_acronyms()
```

Comment out `check_acronyms()`, and run the file. This should create a list of acronyms in random order. This will force you to reevaluate every new TLA that you are presented with, instead of anticipating the next one, or groaning at how many are left.

Next, uncomment `check_acronyms()`, and comment out `check_acronyms()`. And you're set! Whenever you have a few spare moments, run `acronyms.py`, and get going. The script will track your progress with each submitted answer, so there is no danger in losing previously submitted data. Tie it to your own repo, and you can make sure that this data is not lost. 

Happy clicking!
